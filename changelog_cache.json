(Thanks Pippz)\n- Echo added to Splitpaw\n- Mortal Coil is no longer blocked by random clickies\n- Villagers in HoHA are now tethered and will not run full marathons.\n- 61-65 LDoN spells have been added to PoP parchment turn in rewards\n- 50-60 LDoN spells have been added to Warders, Ancients, Lords and Ladies in Velious\n- Mistakenly remaining GoD and OoW spells have been removed from PoK vendors *and* player spellbooks.\n- Lvl 62 BST and lvl 63 Necro pet now correctly scale their level.\n- The likelihood of finding weapon augments has increased on the Glamour NPC.\n- Aspect of the Reptile duration has been increased.\n- /shield now works for Warriors level 30 or greater\n- All entities are capped at 35 worn Shielding\n- Switched Prismatic Strike to Chromatic resist type\n```",

Please report any instances of randomly not being able to cast or perform certain other activities.\n- All starting AA now cost 0 points; this may cause your current 'spent' AA total to decrease when it is next updated.\n- Significantly reduced the complexity of checking for bard song auto-refresh\n- Poisons are no longer equippable.\n- Removed several remaining class checks on epics.\n```\n\nNew Features\n```\n- The Purveyor of Glamour will create Glamour-Stones (Transmog Ornaments) for Armor!\n  - NOT Hero's Forge.\n  - Works with modern & legacy player models\n  - 5Kpp + sacrificial item\n  - Not Dyable\n\n- Removed tradeskill recipe for Vial of Prismatic Dye\n- Added Vial of Prismatic Dye to Augs merchant in Bazaar\n- Adjusted Vial of Prismatic Dye pricing (Sell from vendor @ 50k, Buy from vendor @ 100p)\n\n- The Purveyor of Glamour will now create 'Hero's Forge' style Armor Glamour-Stones!\n  - Generated through 'custom work' randomization system\n  - 2 EoM each, tradable.\n\n- The Vision of Ayonae can now reset your AA!\n  - Each character gets one free reset\n  - Subsequent resets cost 10 EoM and incur a stacking 7 day cooldown (identical to dropping a class)\n\n- Added Petamorph Wands: Wrulon, Phoenix (Red, Blue), Telmira, Stoneworker, Giant Ant, Gorilla, Crushbone Orc, Lightning Dervish, Lava Dervish, Stone Dervish\n- Pets will spawn using the appearance of any equipped Petamorph Wands\n```\n\nThe Vial of Prismatic Dye changes are likely going to be something that many people disagree with. We are choosing the take a different experience for armor appearance customization on this server vs official or other emulated servers. I feel that armor dyes are a 'quick and dirty' solution that allows getting whatever appearance you want quickly and easily, and removes a lot of the fun in finding the exact combination of gear to achieve the look you want. Transmog accomplishes this better, and serves as a plat sink that we definitely need. However, I am leaving Dyes in-game, for those who do want to use that shortcut, with an additional plat sink component.\n\n\nAdditionally, for those who do not want to deal with Heros' Forge armor appearances, please remember they can be disabled in the Options menu.",

The ID of these items is not predictable, as they are assigned JIT.  \n  - Notable limitations:\n    - Dynamic Items may not be sold to NPC vendors (forced to 0-value)\n    - Dynamic Items may not be traded to NPCs\n    - Dynamic Items may not dropped on the ground\n* Implemented Artifacts;\n  - Artifacts have a chance to be generated when a player recieves a Legendary item through Loot, Tradeskill, or Quests\n  - Artifacts are Dynamic Items.\n  - Artifacts are named after the player who found them, and can be discovered once per Season (Non-Season is Season 0)\n* Implemented 'Leveling' items in Power Source slot\n  - Items placed in Power Source slot block player from gaining XP normally\n  - They accumulate XP until they reach a sufficient amount based on their stats, and then upgrade to the next tier (ie Normal->Tier1->Tier2)\n```",
